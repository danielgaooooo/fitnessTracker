# fitnessTracker
basic workout generator if you're too lazy to write your own

Give your workout preferences:
- What is your split? (upper/lower, pull/push/legs, etc.)
- What do you want to work? (pull day, leg day, etc.)
- Any emphases? (small calves, more biceps, etc., or none)
- How long do you want your workout?
- What are your workout goals? (Tone, build mass, strength training, etc.)
